A Ruby on Rails application that runs on a Vagrant virtual machine. Columbia University professors can create an account, log in, view the courses they teach, and create a pre-requisite test for the course. Columbia University students can then create an account, log in, and take a test that has been uploaded. Professors can then view the results of all students who have taken the test and decide which students to approve for the course. The application was created with the hope of reducing unqualified over-enrollment that exists in Columbia's Computer Science Department. The application was written in collaboration with Jon Balsano (@jrbalsano), Chris D'Angelo (@mychrisdangelo), and Neal Hu for Advanced Software Engineering (w4156).
